# ntfy Transport Behavior

## 2026-02-24: Upload mode regression on ntfy.sh
- Verified with both `requests` and `curl` that posting with filename headers (`X-Filename` and `Filename`) consistently returns `HTTP 500` from `ntfy.sh`.
- Regular message posts (plain body, no upload headers) return `HTTP 200` for the same topics.
- `send.py` uses upload mode intentionally (user requirement to bypass message-body limits), so current failures are surfaced with detailed HTTP response logging instead of being hidden.
